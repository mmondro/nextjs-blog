**My Portfolio Website
**
Welcome to my portfolio website! This site was built using Next.js, a JavaScript framework for building server-rendered React applications. It was also styled with Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework.

The site is hosted on Vercel, a cloud platform for hosting web applications.

Responsive design for optimal viewing on any device
A clean, modern aesthetic
Easy navigation with a fixed header and smooth scroll behavior
A blog section featuring articles I have written
A contact form for visitors to get in touch with me
